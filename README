SRec is a program for recording videos from whatever is happening on your
computer screen (useful for making tutorials, showing off games/programs,
etc.). This is a pure software solution so no extra hardware is needed in
order to use it.

Requirements:

- AmigaOS 4.1 Final Edition.
- Graphics card and driver with hardware compositing support.
- NOTE: The Radeon HD lite driver included on the AmigaOS 4.1 FE CD is not
  usable with SRec as it has support for hardware compositing disabled.

Installation:

Use the supplied Install script or just copy the executable where you want it
on your harddrive.

Usage:

Make sure a filename is selected in the GUI.

To start recording either:

A) Bring up SRec's GUI by either using it's configured CX_POPKEY or double-
   clicking on the program's icon and press the "Record" button.

B) If you have configured a "RECORDKEY" (SRec tooltypes) you can use this to
   start recording without using the GUI (you need to have an output file
   selected though).
   
To stop recording:

A) Press the "Stop" button in the GUI.

B) If you have configured a "STOPKEY" you can use this to stop recording,
   otherwise you can use the "RECORDKEY". Note that if you want the same key
   combination to both start and stop recording then configure the "RECORDKEY"
   but leave the "STOPKEY" disabled.

It's also possible to record by running SRec from the CLI. To get the template
for the CLI arguments just type in "SRec ?". Recording is then stopped with
CTRL-C.
